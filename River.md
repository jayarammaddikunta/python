The Krishna river originates in the Western Ghats near Mahabaleshwar at an elevation of about 1,300 metres (4,300 ft), in the state of Maharashtra in central India. The Krishna river is around 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) in length (282 kilometres (175 mi) in Maharashtra). It is one of the most suitable arable basins in the world as 75.6% of the Krishna basin is under cultivation due to the availability of water. The river
var = 's source is at Mahabaleshwar near Jor village in the extreme north of Wai Taluka, Satara District, Maharashtra in the west, and it empties into the Bay of Bengal at Hamasaladeevi (near Koduru) in Andhra Pradesh on the east coast. The river flows through the state of Karnataka before entering Telangana state. The delta of this river is one of the most fertile regions in India and was home to the ancient Satavahana and Ikshvaku Sun Dynasty kings. Vijayawada and Sangli are the largest cities on the Krishna.
